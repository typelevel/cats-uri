 * [[PercentDecoder#decode]]. Because this class goes from `String` to `A`, it necessarily
 * implies parsing as well as decoding.
 *
 * This class also allows for the definition of percent encoding laws, e.g. that any value
 * encoded, should always decode successfully to the original value.

/**
 * Functions in [[PercentDecoder]] provide an implementation of percent decoding.
 *
 * Percent encoded values are `String` values which have sequences of "%XX" where 'X' is a valid
 * hexidecimal character. These '%' prefixed are octets representing UTF-8 byte sequences.
 * Decoding percent encoded `String` values is the process of converting percent prefixed
 * sequences into their the unicode characters represented by the bytes.
 *
 * Percent decoding may fail. This is because not all byte sequences represent valid Unicode
 * characters and according to RFC-3986 percent encoded values should represent characters.
 * `String` values which contain incomplete '%' encoded values also fail percent decoding.
 *
 * A RFC-3986 encoded values is ''not'' the same as a "x-www-form-urlencoded" value, though
 * these two encodings are often treated as the same. The primary distinction between the
 * encodings is that "x-www-form-urlencoded" encoded values represent the space character, ' ',
 * as '+' while percent encoded values represent it using the percent encoded octet mapping to
 * the UTF-8 byte representation, in this case "%20".
 *
 * Another distinction between RFC-3986 percent encoded values and "x-www-form-urlencoded"
 * values is how they handle invalid data. Many "x-www-form-urlencoded" decoders do not fail,
 * handling invalid data by either passing it through, in the case of partial data such as
 * "abc%1g" (%1 is not complete) or by replacing invalid characters with the Unicode replacment
 * character \ufffd. The character replacement strategy used here is a valid when decoding
 * arbitrary textual data and referenced in the Unicode standard, but can not be used with URIs
 * as it can be used to promote an invalid URI into a valid one. This is because \ufffd ''can''
 * occur in a URI (if percent encoded) and if a decoder were to take a URI, or component
 * thereof, containing an invalid byte sequence and replace it with \ufffd, the result would be
 * a valid URI.
 *
 * @see
 *   [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1]]
 * @see
 *   [[https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#gen8]]
